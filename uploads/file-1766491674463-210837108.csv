Amlodipine / Atorvastatin ,5 mg/ 10 mg,"Anticholesterol-HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors - Calcium channel blockers, selective calcium channel blockers with mainly vascular effects-",Tablet,"is indicated for the following patient populations:
1. Patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to the presence of the two modifiable risk factors
hypertension and dyslipidemia; and/or
2. Patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to the presence of symptomatic Coronary Heart
Disease (CHD) expressed as angina with the additional modifiable risk factor of dyslipidemia;
and/or
3. Prevention of cardiovascular complications in hypertensive patients (see below - Prevention of
Cardiovascular Complications).
In these patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, amlodipine/atorvastatin is indicated for:
Hypertension1
The amlodipine component is indicated for the first-line treatment of hypertension and can be used as the
sole agent to control blood pressure (BP) in the majority of patients. Patients not adequately controlled on
a single antihypertensive agent (other than amlodipine) may benefit from the addition of the amlodipine
component of amlodipine/atorvastatin, in the same manner as they would benefit from the addition of
amlodipine alone.
Amlodipine is also indicated to reduce the risk of fatal CHD and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and
to reduce the risk of stroke. 

Coronary Artery Disease1
The amlodipine component is indicated to reduce the risk of coronary revascularization procedures and the need for hospitalization due to angina in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Chronic Stable Angina
The amlodipine component is indicated for the first-line treatment of myocardial ischemia, whether due to fixed obstruction (stable angina) and/or vasospasm/vasoconstriction (Prinzmetal’s or variant angina) of coronary vasculature. Amlodipine/atorvastatin may be used where the clinical presentation suggests a possible vasospastic/vasoconstrictive component but where vasospasm/vasoconstriction has not been
confirmed. Amlodipine/atorvastatin may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal drugs in patients with angina that is refractory to nitrates and/or adequate doses of beta blockers.

Dyslipidemia
The atorvastatin component is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and triglycerides (TG) and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia), combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb), elevated serum TG levels (Fredrickson Type IV), and in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet.
The atorvastatin component is also indicated for the reduction of total C and LDL-C in patients with
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
Prevention of Cardiovascular Complications
In patients without clinically evident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and with or without dyslipidemia, but
with multiple risk factors for CHD such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low HDL-C, or a family history
of early CHD, atorvastatin is indicated to: Reduce the risk of fatal CHD and non-fatal MI
- Reduce the risk of stroke
- Reduce the risk of revascularization procedures and angina pectoris
In patients with clinically evident CHD, atorvastatin is indicated to:
- Reduce the risk of non-fatal MI
- Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke
- Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures
- Reduce the risk of hospitalization for congestive heart failure (CHF)
- Reduce the risk of angina

Disease (CHD) expressed as angina with the additional modifiable risk factor of dyslipidemia;
and/or
3. Prevention of cardiovascular complications in hypertensive patients (see below - Prevention of
Cardiovascular Complications).
In these patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, amlodipine/atorvastatin is indicated for:
Hypertension1
The amlodipine component is indicated for the first-line treatment of hypertension and can be used as the
sole agent to control blood pressure (BP) in the majority of patients. Patients not adequately controlled on
a single antihypertensive agent (other than amlodipine) may benefit from the addition of the amlodipine
component of amlodipine/atorvastatin, in the same manner as they would benefit from the addition of
amlodipine alone.
Amlodipine is also indicated to reduce the risk of fatal CHD and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and
to reduce the risk of stroke. 

Coronary Artery Disease1
The amlodipine component is indicated to reduce the risk of coronary revascularization procedures and the need for hospitalization due to angina in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Chronic Stable Angina
The amlodipine component is indicated for the first-line treatment of myocardial ischemia, whether due to fixed obstruction (stable angina) and/or vasospasm/vasoconstriction (Prinzmetal’s or variant angina) of coronary vasculature. Amlodipine/atorvastatin may be used where the clinical presentation suggests a possible vasospastic/vasoconstrictive component but where vasospasm/vasoconstriction has not been
confirmed. Amlodipine/atorvastatin may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal drugs in patients with angina that is refractory to nitrates and/or adequate doses of beta blockers.

Dyslipidemia
The atorvastatin component is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and triglycerides (TG) and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia), combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb), elevated serum TG levels (Fredrickson Type IV), and in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet.
The atorvastatin component is also indicated for the reduction of total C and LDL-C in patients with
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
Prevention of Cardiovascular Complications
In patients without clinically evident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and with or without dyslipidemia, but
with multiple risk factors for CHD such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low HDL-C, or a family history
of early CHD, atorvastatin is indicated to: Reduce the risk of fatal CHD and non-fatal MI
- Reduce the risk of stroke
- Reduce the risk of revascularization procedures and angina pectoris
In patients with clinically evident CHD, atorvastatin is indicated to:
- Reduce the risk of non-fatal MI

hypertension and dyslipidemia; and/or
2. Patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to the presence of symptomatic Coronary Heart
Disease (CHD) expressed as angina with the additional modifiable risk factor of dyslipidemia;
and/or
3. Prevention of cardiovascular complications in hypertensive patients (see below - Prevention of
Cardiovascular Complications).
In these patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, amlodipine/atorvastatin is indicated for:
Hypertension1
The amlodipine component is indicated for the first-line treatment of hypertension and can be used as the
sole agent to control blood pressure (BP) in the majority of patients. Patients not adequately controlled on
a single antihypertensive agent (other than amlodipine) may benefit from the addition of the amlodipine
component of amlodipine/atorvastatin, in the same manner as they would benefit from the addition of
amlodipine alone.
Amlodipine is also indicated to reduce the risk of fatal CHD and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and
to reduce the risk of stroke. 

Coronary Artery Disease1
The amlodipine component is indicated to reduce the risk of coronary revascularization procedures and the need for hospitalization due to angina in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Chronic Stable Angina
The amlodipine component is indicated for the first-line treatment of myocardial ischemia, whether due to fixed obstruction (stable angina) and/or vasospasm/vasoconstriction (Prinzmetal’s or variant angina) of coronary vasculature. Amlodipine/atorvastatin may be used where the clinical presentation suggests a possible vasospastic/vasoconstrictive component but where vasospasm/vasoconstriction has not been
confirmed. Amlodipine/atorvastatin may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal drugs in patients with angina that is refractory to nitrates and/or adequate doses of beta blockers.

Dyslipidemia
The atorvastatin component is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and triglycerides (TG) and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia), combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb), elevated serum TG levels (Fredrickson Type IV), and in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet.
The atorvastatin component is also indicated for the reduction of total C and LDL-C in patients with
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).
Prevention of Cardiovascular Complications
In patients without clinically evident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and with or without dyslipidemia, but
with multiple risk factors for CHD such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, low HDL-C, or a family history
of early CHD, atorvastatin is indicated to: Reduce the risk of fatal CHD and non-fatal MI
- Reduce the risk of stroke
- Reduce the risk of revascularization procedures and angina pectoris
In patients with clinically evident CHD, atorvastatin is indicated to:
- Reduce the risk of non-fatal MI

Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) should not exceed 40 mg daily.

Contraindicated in Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and those with unexplained persistent abnormal liver function tests .  

Liver enzyme abnormalities 
Lomitapide can cause elevations in the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and hepatic steatosis. 

There have been no concomitant or subsequent clinically meaningful elevations in serum bilirubin, International Normalised Ratio (INR), or alkaline phosphatase. The extent to which lomitapide-associated hepatic steatosis promotes the elevations in aminotransferase is unknown. The liver enzyme changes can occur at any time during therapy, but occur most often during dose escalation. 

Although cases of hepatic dysfunction (elevated aminotransferase with increase in bilirubin or INR) or hepatic failure have not been reported, there is concern that lomitapide could induce steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis over several years. The clinical studies supporting the safety and efficacy of lomitapide in HoFH would have been unlikely to detect this adverse outcome given their size and duration. 

Monitoring of liver function tests 
Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) and serum albumin before initiation of treatment with this Product. The medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and those with unexplained persistent abnormal liver function tests. If the baseline liver-related tests are abnormal, consider initiating the medicinal product after appropriate investigation by a hepatologist and the baseline abnormalities are explained or resolved.

During the first year, measure liver-related tests (ALT and AST, at a minimum) prior to each increase in dose or monthly, whichever occurs first. After the first year, do these tests at least every 3 months and before any increase in dose. Decrease the dose of this Product if elevations of aminotransferase are observed and discontinue treatment for persistent or clinically significant elevations (check SmPc). 
.

If aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of liver injury (such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, lethargy, flu-like symptoms), increases in bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN, or active liver disease, discontinue treatment with this Product and refer the patient to a hepatologist for further investigation. 

Reintroduction of treatment may be considered if the benefits are considered to outweigh the risks associated with potential liver disease. 

Hepatic steatosis and risk of progressive liver disease 
Consistent with the mechanism of action of lomitapide, most treated patients exhibited increases in hepatic fat content. In an open-label Phase 3 study, 18 of 23 patients with HoFH developed hepatic steatosis (hepatic fat > 5.56%) as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (see section 5.1). The median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 weeks and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by MRS. Hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for progressive liver disease including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. 

The long term consequences of hepatic steatosis associated with lomitapide treatment are unknown. Clinical data suggest that hepatic fat accumulation is reversible after stopping treatment with this Product, but whether histological sequelae remain is unknown, especially after long-term use

Monitoring for evidence of progressive liver disease. 
Regular screening for steatohepatitis/fibrosis should be performed at baseline and on an annual basis using the following imaging and biomarker evaluations: 
• Imaging for tissue elasticity, e.g. Fibroscan, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), or magnetic resonance (MR) elastography 
• Gamma-GT and serum albumin to detect possible liver injury 
• At least one marker from each of the following categories: 
• High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CK-18 Fragment, NashTest (liver inflammation) 
• Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel, Fibrometer, AST/ALT ratio, Fib-4 score, Fibrotest (liver fibrosis) 

The performance of these tests and their interpretation should involve collaboration between the treating physician and the hepatologist. Patients with results suggesting the presence of steatohepatitis or fibrosis should be considered for liver biopsy. 

If a patient has biopsy-proven steatohepatitis or fibrosis, the benefit-risk should be reassessed and treatment stopped if necessary.

Given its mechanism of action in the small intestine, lomitapide may reduce the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. In the Phase 3 study, patients were provided daily dietary supplements of vitamin E, linoleic acid, ALA, EPA and DHA. 

In this study, the median levels of serum vitamin E, ALA, linoleic acid, EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid decreased from baseline to Week 26 but remained above the lower limit of the reference range. Adverse clinical consequences of these reductions were not observed with lomitapide treatment of up to 78 weeks.

In common with other statins, Pitavstatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with pre-disposing factors for rhabdomyolysis. A creatinine kinase level should be measured, to establish a reference baseline, in the following situations:
• renal impairment,
• hypothyroidism,
• personal or family history of hereditary muscular disorders,
• previous history of muscular toxicity with a fibrate or another statin,
• history of liver disease or alcohol abuse,
• elderly patients (over 70 years) with other predisposing risk factors for rhabdomyolysis,

In such situations, clinical monitoring is recommended and the risk of treatment should be considered in relation to the possible benefit. Treatment with Pitavstatin should not be started if CK values are >5x ULN.

During Treatment
Patients must be encouraged to report muscle pain, weakness or cramps immediately. Creatine kinase levels should be measured and treatment stopped if CK levels are elevated (>5x ULN). Stopping treatment should be considered if muscular symptoms are severe even if CK levels are 5x ULN. If symptoms resolve and CK levels return to normal, then re-introduction of Pitavstatin may be considered at a dose of 1mg and with close monitoring.

",NA,"During the first 3 months of treatment, the liver function parameters AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and γ-GT should be monitored by the physician every 4 weeks, thereafter every 3 months. Apart from allowing for identification of responders and non-responders in patients being treated for primary biliary cirrhosis, this monitoring would also enable early detection of potential hepatic deterioration, particularly in patients with advanced stage primary biliary cirrhosis.

Dissolving of cholesterol stones:
Preferably, this single dose should be taken one hour before bedtime and ± two hours
after the evening meal with a glass of milk or a small snack.

The duration of the treatment in order to obtain lysis of the gallstones depends on their size, but is usually not shorter than three to four months. To assess the result of the therapy properly, it is necessary to determine the size of the stones accurately at the start of the treatment and to check this further regularly, for example every six months, by means of a new contrast X-ray recording and/or sonographic recording.

In patients in whom, after six months of treatment with the indicated dosage, the stones are not reduced in size, it is recommended to determine the lithogenic index in the bile by means of a duodenum drainage. When the bile has an index of >1.0, it is unlikely that a favourable result can be obtained, and it is better to consider a different form of treatment
for the gallstones.

Treatment should be continued for three to four months after it is established by means of ultrasound check that the gallstones are completely dissolved. An interruption of the treatment for three to four weeks results in a return to over-saturation of the bile and prolongs the overall duration of the therapy. The interruption of the treatment after the dissolving of the gallstones can be followed by a recurrence,

When used for dissolving gallstones:
In order to be able to assess the therapeutic progression of the dissolution of gallstones and to timely identify a possible calcification of the stones, the gall bladder, depending on the size of the stones, should be visualized 6 to 10 months after the start of the treatment (oral cholecystography) with total image and occlusions and in the standing and lying position (ultrasound investigation).
If the gallbladder cannot be visualized on X-rays, or in cases of calcified gallstones, impaired contractility of the gall bladder or frequent episodes of biliary colic, the treatment with Ursodeoxycholic acid should be discontinued 

In patients with PBC, the clinical symptoms may worsen in rare cases at the start of treatment, e.g. pruritus may increase. In this case, the therapy is to be continued with a dose reduction and subsequently should be gradually increased to the recommended dose. 

If diarrhoea occurs, the dosage should be reduced, and treatment should be discontinued in case of persistent diarrhoea.

During the first 3 months of treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid should be taken in divided doses throughout the day. If liver function improves, the total daily dose can be taken once daily in the evening.
Stage IV:
In combination with increased serum bilirubin levels (> 40 μg/L; conjugated), only half the normal dosage should initially be given (see dosage for stages I  - III), (6 - 8 mg ursodeoxycholic acid per kg body weight per day, equivalent to about 2 to 3 ursodeoxycholic acid).
Thereafter, liver function should be closely monitored for several weeks (once every 2 weeks for 6 weeks). If there is no deterioration in liver function (AP, ALAT, ASAT, gamma-GT, bilirubin) and if no increased pruritus occurs, the dosage can be increased further to the usual level. However, liver function should again be closely monitored for several weeks. Once again, if there is no deterioration in liver function, the patient can be maintained at the normal dosage over the long term.
Patients with primary biliary cholangitis (stage IV) without increased serum bilirubin levels are allowed to receive the normal starting dose immediately (see dosage stages I - III).

The dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cholangitis stage IV and an increase of the serum bilirubin contents (> 40μg/l), should be in the first instance, only a half of the normal dose (6 to 8 mg/kg/day). Thereafter, the liver function should be closely monitored for several weeks (once every two weeks for six weeks). If there is no deterioration of the liver function (AF,ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), γ-GT, bilirubin) and no increase in itching occurs, the dose may be further increased to the usual level.

Moreover, the liver function must then again be closely monitored for several weeks. If again no deterioration of the liver function takes place, the patient may be held at the normal dosage for a long time.
In patients with primary biliary cholangitis stage IV without elevated serum bilirubin, the usual starting dose is allowed to be administered directly. Anyway, here too an accurate control of the liver function should be executed.
The treatment of the primary biliary cholangitis should be regularly assessed on the basis of liver values (laboratory) and clinical findings. 

Improved serum liver tests do not always correlate with improved liver disease status so, during the first three months of the treatment liver function parameters AST (SGOT),
ALT (SGPT) and γ-GT should be monitored by the physician every 4 weeks, thereafter every 3 months. Apart from allowing for identification of responders and non-responders in patients being treated for primary biliary cholangitis, this monitoring would also enable an early detection of potential hepatic deterioration, particularly in patients with advanced primary biliary cholangitis.

Treatment should be discontinued if the levels of these parameters increase.
Long-term use of doses exceeding the recommended dose of ursodiol (i.e., 13-15 mg/kg/d) was associated with improvement in serum liver tests but did not improve survival, and was associated with higher rates of serious adverse events (including death or liver transplantation) compared to placebo.

When used for dissolving gallstones:
In order to be able to assess the therapeutic progression of the dissolution of gallstones and to timely identify a possible calcification of the stones, the gall bladder, depending on the size of the stones, should be visualized 6 to 10 months after the start of the treatment (oral cholecystography) with total image and occlusions and in the standing and lying position (ultrasound investigation).
If the gallbladder cannot be visualized on X-rays, or in cases of calcified gallstones, impaired contractility of the gall bladder or frequent episodes of biliary colic, the treatment with Ursodeoxycholic acid should be discontinued

In patients with PBC, the clinical symptoms may worsen in rare cases at the start of treatment, e.g. pruritus may increase. In this case, the therapy is to be continued with a dose reduction and subsequently should be gradually increased to the recommended dose. 

If diarrhoea occurs, the dosage should be reduced, and treatment should be discontinued in case of persistent diarrhoea.

The duration of the treatment in order to obtain lysis of the gallstones depends on their size, but is usually not shorter than three to four months. To assess the result of the therapy properly, it is necessary to determine the size of the stones accurately at the start of the treatment and to check this further regularly, for example every six months, by means of a new contrast X-ray recording and/or sonographic recording.

In patients in whom, after six months of treatment with the indicated dosage, the stones are not reduced in size, it is recommended to determine the lithogenic index in the bile by means of a duodenum drainage.

In patients with PBC, the clinical symptoms may worsen in rare cases at the start of treatment, e.g. pruritus may increase. In this case, the therapy is to be continued with a dose reduction and subsequently should be gradually increased to the recommended dose. 

If diarrhoea occurs, the dosage should be reduced, and treatment should be discontinued in case of persistent diarrhoea.

The daily dose depends on body weight, and ranges from 3 to 7 capsules (14 ± 2 mg UDCA per kg of body weight).

For the first 3 months of treatment, Ursoplus 250 mg/140 mg capsules should be taken divided over the day. With improvement of the liver values the daily dose may be taken once daily in the evening. (Check Table of doses),

The capsules should be swallowed whole with some liquid. Care should be taken to ensure that they are taken regularly.
The use of This Product 250mg/140mg capsules in PBC may be continued indefinitely.

Dissolution of Gallstones:
Adults: The usual dose is 8-12mg/kg/day to be taken in the evening, e.g. 750mg, daily in the
evening.

The time required for dissolution of gallstones is likely to range from 6 to 24 months
depending on stone size and composition

Ursodeoxycholic acid tablets should not be used in patients with:

- Occlusion of the biliary tract (occlusion of the common bile duct or a cystic duct).

",NA,"Follow-up cholecystograms or ultrasound investigation may be useful at 6 month intervals until the gallstones have disappeared.

Treatment should be continued until 2 successive cholecystograms and/or ultrasound investigations 4-12 weeks apart have failed to demonstrate gallstones. This is because these techniques do not permit reliable visualisation of stones less than 2mm in diameter. The likelihood of recurrence of gallstones after dissolution by bile acid treatment has been estimated as up to 50% at 5 years. The efficiency of This Product in treating radio-opaque or partially radio-opaque gallstones has not been tested but these are generally thought to be less soluble than radiolucent stones. Non-cholesterol stones account for 10-15% of radiolucent stones and may not be dissolved by bile acids.
During the first 3 months of treatment, the liver function parameters AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and γ-GT should be monitored by the physician every 4 weeks, thereafter every 3 months. Apart from allowing for identification of responders and non-responders in patients being treated for primary biliary cirrhosis, this monitoring would also enable early detection of potential hepatic deterioration, particularly in patients with advanced stage primary biliary cirrhosis.

Dissolving of cholesterol stones:
Preferably, this single dose should be taken one hour before bedtime and ± two hours
after the evening meal with a glass of milk or a small snack.

The duration of the treatment in order to obtain lysis of the gallstones depends on their size, but is usually not shorter than three to four months. To assess the result of the therapy properly, it is necessary to determine the size of the stones accurately at the start of the treatment and to check this further regularly, for example every six months, by means of a new contrast X-ray recording and/or sonographic recording.

In patients in whom, after six months of treatment with the indicated dosage, the stones are not reduced in size, it is recommended to determine the lithogenic index in the bile by means of a duodenum drainage. When the bile has an index of >1.0, it is unlikely that a favourable result can be obtained, and it is better to consider a different form of treatment
for the gallstones.

Treatment should be continued for three to four months after it is established by means of ultrasound check that the gallstones are completely dissolved. An interruption of the treatment for three to four weeks results in a return to over-saturation of the bile and prolongs the overall duration of the therapy. The interruption of the treatment after the dissolving of the gallstones can be followed by a recurrence,

When used for dissolving gallstones:
In order to be able to assess the therapeutic progression of the dissolution of gallstones and to timely identify a possible calcification of the stones, the gall bladder, depending on the size of the stones, should be visualized 6 to 10 months after the start of the treatment (oral cholecystography) with total image and occlusions and in the standing and lying position (ultrasound investigation).
If the gallbladder cannot be visualized on X-rays, or in cases of calcified gallstones, impaired contractility of the gall bladder or frequent episodes of biliary colic, the treatment with Ursodeoxycholic acid should be discontinued

If diarrhoea occurs, the dosage should be reduced, and treatment should be discontinued in case of persistent diarrhoea.
